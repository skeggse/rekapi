# Rekapi source style guide

Generally speaking, Rekapi follows the [Google JavaScript style guide][style]

Things to keep in mind:

  * Please use semicolons
  * All functions require [Google Closure-style annotations][closure-compiler]
  * Favor clarity over cleverness and don't write pre-obfuscated code

Pull Requests that do not adhere to the style guide will still be happily accepted, but the source will be reformatted after the fact.  If you would like to prolong your per-line attribution, it is best to stick to this style guide.
